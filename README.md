Answer all questions.    State any assumptions you make and explain your answers. The total number of marks is 90.
1. Choose whether the following statements are true or false. If a statement is false, explain why? [10] 
T          F The   enthalpy   of mixing   in   ideal   solution   is   independent   of temperature,   while
the   enthalpy   of   mixing   in   regular   solution   depends   on   temperature.T          F In   a   typical   phase   diagram,   as   temperature   decreases,   the   Gibbs   free   energy   of
both solid and liquid solution as   a   function of   composition   also   decreases.
T          F The   partial   molar   value   of an   extensive   property   in   a   mixture   of ideal   gases   is
the   same   as   the   molar   property   of   its   pure   component.
T          F When   A-B   solution   shows   positive   deviation   from   Raoult’s   law,   A-A   and   B-B
components are more likely forming clusters in   solution.
T          F For   a   non-ideal   gas,   molar   volume   of   vapor   and   liquid   keep   constant   during
transformation from vapor to liquid below the critical pressure.
